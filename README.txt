The provided folders is how we would recommend organizing your code. 
Regardless of how you organize it, make sure you are very specific in how you
did so here. The easier you make it to grade, the more merciful we can be
(as we will appreciate your forsight and planning).

We also recommend adding a folder for your final code (so everything can be in
one place and you won't require nearly as many hard-coded paths).

As a reminder, here are some of the things you will need:
-Explain which parts of the midterm you have and haven’t finished
-Include a list of filepaths to the following important files
  –Your source code files for each part of the midterm
  –Your batch file for NX (if you used one)
  –Your batch file for ANSYS
  –Any created executables/dlls
  –Any other important files for your submission to work properly.
  –The locations of the temporary files you created (such as your IGES file and
   your maxstress file)
-Include a list of filenames and line numbers than include hard-coded files 
 paths (in-case we need to tweak these to get it to run on our machine)
-Include instructions on how to run your submission (don’t forget about filepaths)
-Explain anything else relevant for the TAs to know about your submission
